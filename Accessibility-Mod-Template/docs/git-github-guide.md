# Git and GitHub Guide for Beginners

This guide explains Git and GitHub from scratch. No prior knowledge required.

## What is Git?

Git is a "version history" for your project. Imagine you're writing a document:
- You make changes throughout the day
- At certain points, you save a snapshot: "Menu navigation working"
- If something breaks later, you can go back to any snapshot
- You can see exactly what changed between any two snapshots

These snapshots are called **commits**. Git stores them all locally on your computer.

**Why is this useful for modding?**
- You just got the inventory working, then you break it while adding the shop. With Git, you can go back to "inventory working."
- You can see what you changed since the last working version.
- When you want to share your mod, you need Git to upload to GitHub.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a website where you store your Git project online. Think of it as:
- A backup of your project in the cloud
- A place where others can download your mod
- A place where people can report bugs (Issues)
- A place where you publish releases (ZIP files of your mod)

Git works locally on your computer. GitHub is the online copy.

## Setting Up Git

### Install Git

Git is likely already installed if you followed the README setup instructions. Check with:
```
git --version
```

If not installed, download from: https://git-scm.com/downloads

### Configure Git (once)

Tell Git who you are (this appears in your commits):
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

**Tip:** Use the same email you use for GitHub.

### Create a GitHub Account

1. Go to https://github.com and sign up
2. Choose a username (this will be visible publicly)
3. Verify your email

### Install GitHub CLI (optional but recommended)

The GitHub CLI (`gh`) lets you do GitHub things from the command line:
```
winget install GitHub.cli
```

Then log in:
```
gh auth login
```

Follow the prompts. This is a one-time setup.

## Starting Version Control for Your Mod

### Initialize Git in Your Project

Open PowerShell in your mod project folder and run:
```
git init
```

This creates a hidden `.git` folder that stores all version history.

### Create a .gitignore File

Before your first commit, create a file called `.gitignore` in your project root. This tells Git which files to NOT track:

```
# Build output
bin/
obj/

# Decompiled game code (large, can be regenerated)
decompiled/

# Visual Studio
.vs/
*.user
*.suo

# OS files
Thumbs.db
Desktop.ini

# MelonLoader output (don't commit game DLLs)
*.dll
!templates/**

# Local IDE settings
.idea/
.vscode/
```

**Why ignore `decompiled/`?** The decompiled game code can be thousands of files and megabytes. It can be regenerated from the game DLL, so there's no need to store it in Git. It would also make your GitHub repository unnecessarily large.

### Your First Commit

A commit is a snapshot. Here's how to make one:

```
git add .gitignore
git add CLAUDE.md
git add docs/
git add templates/
git add scripts/
git add Main.cs
git add ScreenReader.cs
git add YourMod.csproj
```

Then commit (save the snapshot):
```
git commit -m "Initial project setup with basic framework"
```

**Important:** Only add files you actually want to track. Never add:
- `.dll` files (binary, regenerated by building)
- `decompiled/` folder (large, regenerated)
- Credentials or personal data

## Daily Git Workflow

### The Basic Cycle

1. **Work on your code** (with Claude Code helping you)
2. **When something works:** Make a commit
3. **Continue working** on the next thing
4. **When you want to backup online:** Push to GitHub

### Making Commits

Check what changed:
```
git status
```

This shows:
- **Modified files:** Files you changed
- **Untracked files:** New files Git doesn't know about yet

Add the files you want to commit:
```
git add Main.cs
git add InventoryHandler.cs
```

Or add all changed/new files at once:
```
git add -A
```

Commit with a message describing what you did:
```
git commit -m "Add inventory navigation with arrow keys"
```

**Good commit messages:**
- "Add main menu keyboard navigation"
- "Fix shop prices not being announced"
- "Add German localization for inventory"

**Bad commit messages:**
- "stuff" (what stuff?)
- "fix" (fix what?)
- "asdf" (not helpful at all)

### When to Commit

Commit after:
- A feature is working (even partially)
- Before you start a major change (safety net!)
- Before you stop working for the day
- Before trying something risky

**Rule of thumb:** If you would be upset to lose the changes you've made since the last commit, it's time to commit.

## Uploading to GitHub

### Create a Repository on GitHub

Using GitHub CLI:
```
gh repo create YourModName --public --description "Accessibility mod for GameName"
```

Or on the website:
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click the "+" button (top right) and select "New repository"
3. Name: Your mod name
4. Description: Short description
5. Public (so people can find and use your mod)
6. Don't add README/gitignore (you already have them)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Connect Your Local Project to GitHub

After creating the repository, connect it:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/YourModName.git
```

### Push (Upload) Your Commits

```
git push -u origin master
```

The `-u origin master` is only needed the first time. After that, just:
```
git push
```

### Pulling Changes (if you edit on another computer)

```
git pull
```

---

## Creating Releases on GitHub

When your mod is ready for others to use:

1. **Build your mod** and create the release ZIP (see distribution-guide.md)

2. **Create a release:**
   ```
   gh release create v1.0.0 YourMod-v1.0.0.zip --title "v1.0.0 - Initial Release" --notes "First release with main menu and inventory navigation"
   ```

3. **Share the link** - The release page URL is what you share with users

---

## Useful Commands Reference

Check status:
```
git status
```

See what changed in detail:
```
git diff
```

See commit history:
```
git log --oneline
```

Undo changes to a file (back to last commit):
```
git checkout -- filename.cs
```

**Be careful with this one - it permanently discards your changes to that file!**

---

## Troubleshooting

**"fatal: not a git repository"**
You're not in a folder with Git initialized. Run `git init` first or navigate to the right folder.

**"error: failed to push some refs"**
Someone (or you on another computer) pushed changes you don't have. Run `git pull` first, then `git push`.

**"Changes not staged for commit"**
You modified files but didn't `git add` them yet. Add them, then commit.

**Accidentally committed something you shouldn't have?**
Tell Claude Code - it can help you remove files from Git history.

---

## Summary: Minimum Workflow

If everything else is too much, just do this:

1. `git init` (once, at project start)
2. Create `.gitignore` (once)
3. `git add -A && git commit -m "description"` (whenever something works)
4. `gh repo create` and `git push` (when ready to share)

That's it. Everything else is optional and can be learned as needed.
