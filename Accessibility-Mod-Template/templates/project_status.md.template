## Setup Progress

- [x] Experience level determined
- [x] Game name and path confirmed
- [x] Game familiarity assessed
- [ ] Game directory auto-check completed
- [ ] Mod loader selected and installed (MelonLoader or BepInEx)
- [ ] Tolk DLLs in place
- [ ] .NET SDK available
- [ ] Decompiler tool ready
- [ ] Game code decompiled to `decompiled/`
- [ ] Tutorial texts extracted (if applicable)
- [ ] Multilingual support decided
- [ ] Project directory set up (csproj, Main.cs, etc.)
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated with project-specific values
- [ ] First build successful
- [ ] "Mod loaded" announcement working in game

## Current Phase

**Phase:** [Setup / Analysis / Framework / Feature Development]
**Currently working on:** [Description of current task]
**Blocked by:** [Any blockers, or "Nothing"]

## Codebase Analysis Progress

### GATE: Tier 1 MUST be complete before Phase 2 (Framework)!

- [ ] 1.1 Structure overview (namespaces, singletons) → documented in game-api.md
- [ ] 1.2 Input system — ALL game key bindings documented in game-api.md "Game Key Bindings"
- [ ] 1.2 Input system — Safe mod keys identified and listed in game-api.md "Safe Mod Keys"
- [ ] 1.3 UI system (base classes, text access patterns, Reflection needed?)
- [ ] 1.4 State management decision → documented in "Architecture Decisions" below
- [ ] 1.5 Localization: game's language system analyzed (only if multilingual)

### GATE: Relevant Tier 2 items MUST be done before implementing each feature!

- [ ] 1.6 Game mechanics (analyzed as needed per feature)
- [ ] 1.7 Status/feedback systems
- [ ] 1.8 Event system / Harmony patch points
- [ ] 1.9 Results documented in `docs/game-api.md`
- [ ] 1.10 Tutorial analysis (when relevant)

## Game Key Bindings (Original)

<!-- CRITICAL: Fill this during Tier 1 analysis! Every key the game uses.
Without this list, mod keys WILL conflict with game controls. -->

- (not yet documented — MUST be done before Phase 2)

<!-- Example:
- WASD / Arrow keys: Movement
- E: Interact
- I: Inventory
- Escape: Pause menu
- Space: Jump
- Tab: (not used by game — safe for mod)
- F1-F12: (not used by game — safe for mod)
-->

## Implemented Features

List features with their status:

- (none yet)

<!-- Example:
- **Main Menu Navigation** - DONE - Arrow keys navigate, Enter activates
- **Settings Menu** - DONE - All sliders and toggles accessible
- **Inventory** - IN PROGRESS - Basic navigation works, item details missing
- **Status Announcements** - PLANNED - F2 for health, F3 for resources
-->

## Pending Tests

What the user should test in the next game session:

- (none yet)

<!-- Example:
- Main menu: Check if all 5 menu items are announced with arrow keys
- Settings: Test slider, check if percentage is read aloud
- Try pressing F2 during gameplay — should announce health
-->

## Known Issues

- (none yet)

<!-- Example:
- Menu navigation sometimes skips an item when scrolling fast
- Shop prices not announced for bundled items
-->

## Architecture Decisions

Document important decisions so future sessions understand the reasoning:

- (none yet)

<!-- Example:
- Using ReflectionHelper for all UI text access (most fields are private)
- State management via AccessStateManager (3+ handlers share arrow keys)
- Manual Harmony patching in OnSceneWasLoaded (typeof() crashes at assembly load)
-->

## Key Bindings (Mod)

- F1: Help
- F12: Toggle debug mode
<!-- Add more as features are implemented -->

## Notes for Next Session

Write anything the next conversation needs to know:

- (none yet)

<!-- Example:
- Left off debugging the inventory handler - item count is correct but item names show as "Unknown"
- Need to check if InventorySlot uses m_ItemName or title field
- User wants crafting menu next
-->
